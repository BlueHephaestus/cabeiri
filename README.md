# Description

Hello! These are messenger bots. As I add more platforms with individual (or merged) bots to support each one, I will add them here. These are created with the goal of making one unified AI-empowered system to receive all messages from all sources (email, text, signal, discord, and so on), then process them however I want. 

At the time of writing, I just wanted to put this on github so a lot of the code is not very cleaned up yet. 

The most recent one is the signal bot, which is empowered with GPT4 and can respond with a rather humorous personality to any messages sent to my account on signal.

More details can be found in each subdirectory!

### Origin of "Cabeiri"
My name is Blue Hephaestus. These bots are called "Cabeiri" and are inspired by the messengers and assistant automatons that the god Hephaestus would create in Greek Mythology. Specifically, he once made automaton horses (of varying number) for his sons, the two gods Cabeiri, to assist them. 

Seeking a good name for these automatons, which function as messengers and assistants, I decided on Cabeiri.
